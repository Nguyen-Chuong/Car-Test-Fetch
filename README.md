About the requirement:
- Using fast api to create restfull api: I am more confident with java so I will use Spring frameword to create my demo
- Using angular to design the UI: Although am familiar with javaScript and library like Angular or React, the last project I created some components and helped the team to complete the design, I still haven't create any Angular application from the begining, plus the time required so I can only provide APIs for the application
